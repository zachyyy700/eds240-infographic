# EDS 240: Final Project - Data Infographic

## About

This repository contains the final project materials for the course EDS 240 - Data Visualization at UCSB's Masters of Environmental Data Science. The project's main goal is to practice data visualizations skills on a dataset of our choice.

## Data

- Horse race data was sourced from [netkeiba](https://www.netkeiba.com/), a website that hosts official Japan Racing Association (JRA) data. This was done by a user on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), an online data science community where users can find and publish datasets. The user who published this horse racing data used web-scraping tools to assimilate the race results data used in the analysis. More information can be found on Kaggle at the user's [public dataset post](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/takamotoki/jra-horse-racing-dataset/data).
